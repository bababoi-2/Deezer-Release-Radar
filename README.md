# Deezer-Release-Radar
A userscript to view new releases of artist you follow, not the ones Deezer thinks you like. Deezers Release Playlist does not feature small artists and features artists you heard 2 times. This radar features only all artists you follow. Designed for the Desktop Browser version, supports both dark and white mode. Tested on Chrome/Firefox with Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey.\
